# ChessSolitaire

## What it does
This is a project bulding using EiffelStudio, the main pupose of this project is to practice different design principle using the visitor design pattern.

## What I learn
This language has a really steep learning curve, I have spend a lot of time to learn the syntaxs and rules. Eiffel focus on the design by contract. On the other hand, I learn how to use composite and visitor pattern to help maintaining the code. I have also learn how to use shell to run tests cases in batch mode and GUI mode.
