# ChessSolitaire

## What it does
This is a project built using Eiffel Programing language, the pupose of this project is to practice different design principles using the composite and visitor design pattern.

## What I learn
This language has a really steep learning curve, I have spent a lot of time to learn the syntaxs and rules. Eiffel focus on the design by contract. On the other hand, I learn how to use composite and visitor pattern to help maintaining the code. I have also learn how to use shell to run tests cases in batch mode and in GUI mode.
